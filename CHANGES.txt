3.6.1dev (unreleased)
---------------------

- fixed #238579 / #163149: error with unicode traversing
- fixed #221025 : adding menu is sorted with translated item
                  by using a collator (better localized sorting)
- fixed #227617 :
    - prevent the namechooser from failing on '+', '@' and '/'
    - added tests in the namechooser
    - be sure the name chooser returns unicode
- fixed #175388 : the setitem's size modification is now done in setitemf:
  setting an existing item does not change the size,
  and the event subscribers should see the new size instead of the old size.
- Reimplemented the BTreeContainer so that it directly accesses the btree
  methods (removed an old #TODO)

3.6.0 (2008-05-06)
------------------

- Added an ``IBTreeContainer`` interface that allows an argument to the
  ``items``, ``keys``, and ``values`` methods with the same semantics as for
  a BTree object.  The extended interface is implemented by the
  ``BTreeContainer`` class.

3.5 (2007-10-11)
----------------

- Updated bootstrap script to current version.
- Store length of ``BTreeContainer`` in its own ``Length`` object for faster
  ``__len__`` implementation of huge containers.
- Send ``IObjectModifiedEvent`` when changing the title through the
  ``@@contents.html`` view.
  This fixes https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98483.
- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` and ``IRolePermissionManager`` deprecation
  warning.

3.4 (2007-04-22)
----------------

- Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.app.container``
  from Zope 3.4.0a1.
